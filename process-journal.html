                  The work of Martin and Stewart really opened my eyes to the scope of an Autonomous world and forced me to ask myself about it’s implications morally and economically.  I am fascinated with the concept of uncertainty in an AI system and how you would be able to communicate the systems state or ‘feeling’ to a user.  Further to this I think that there would be some cool applications for AI augmented interfaces making use of this sensor data. The limitations of flying drones outlined in the lecture helped inform our choice to not use a prop powered device for our final concept.

	                  Hendrik Muller's work was really inspiring I loved his presentation style and the way he carried us through projects he had done while explaining the steps. The fact that they where examples I had used and could relate to made it all the better.  The inclusion of real world limitations to his decision making process was really refreshing, I find the whole blue sky no limits thinking a little tiresome.  His lecture slides were really helpful when deciding on what methods to use in assessment 1&2.

                  To put a chip or not to put a chip.  We have witnessed the rise of IOT devices over that last few years for better or for worse this devices are now commonplace in many people's lives.  However they are plagued with problems that often stop them from delivering on the lifestyle they promised. In addition to network latency and sensor tech that just isn’t quite there yet they also pose many security concerns for their users.  They hold a great deal of promise for the future however I feel we should be cautious to adopt them to hastaly.

                  The ideas of personification we explored in the lecture came back in our final concept image. We chose to implement them quite literally and try to make our blimp as friendly as possible to help people to feel more comfortable with it’s presence.

                <p>The Tutorial exercise helped me to appreciate the usefulness of paper prototyping for UI design.

However I found that not only was it fast but that working in 1:1 helped me to appreciate the scale and position of the elements I was creating.</P>

                <p>I’m still skeptical of the efficiency of this method, I understand the benefit of hand sketching for a first pass on UI concepts.  However I feel as though there would be some reasonable time savings to be had by generating these digitally and printing them instead of hand drawing each screen.  I could be that I am not very fast at sketching but still I found I spend a lot of time redrawing the same basic screens with minor variations and that took a lot of time. I’m also found it very hard to engage with the interface to give meaningful feedback as it was very busy in its hand sketched state. Even basic things like text size and clarity was very difficult with hand drawing. Not to discount the benefits of being able to test complex interactions without programming and to quickly change how those interactions behave on the fly. I do see it’s merits but I’m not sure it’s time efficient.</P>

I found the advice we got on developing these prototypes really helpful. The guidelines laid out in the tutorial gave me a great insight into how to best optimize my layouts for a mobile user.  I only wish the structure of the assessments gave us more opportunity to develop and iterate with higher level prototypes. However I felt all the iteration had to happen in very low fidelity and that was a bit of a bumber</p>

                <p>The brief tutorial in framer was a really nice way to get us started however having now build a fairly complex app with the language I don’t feel it really prepared us. I would have benefited from a deeper explanation of the languages structure and how it deals with different screens or pages.  However the kick start was definitely appreciated.  I really appreciate that we are introduced to a wide variety of tools and given the freedom to work with whatever takes our interest.  While I regret that I haven't taken the opportunity to experiment with all of them the exposure to them has broadened my scope.</P>
