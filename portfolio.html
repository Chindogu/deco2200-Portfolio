        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>We diverged exploring 3 areas of water safety: Public Pools, Domestic Pools, Beaches.
Based on our research we proceed to focus on beach safety. However we feel that much of our work into beach safety would be applicable to the other scenarios.

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p><i> What can we do to help improve safety across Australia's beaches. </i></p>
          <p>The heart and sole of beach safety on our beaches are the Surf Life saving volunteers and the Surf Lifeguard employees.  Together they are responsible for patrolling sand and seas across the nation and building a strong culture of water safety through education and community outreach.</p>
          <p>To tackle this problem we need to understand what tools these stakeholders wanted.  We conducted in depth interviews with a number of Surf life savers and guards to help us understand their needs.</p>
          <h4>Pain points</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>It can be easy to miss someone when the water is choppy and or busy.
            <li>It is hard to tell if someone is actually in distress.
            <li>Giving a clear location of a person in distress can be difficult.
            <li>Prevention is best, understanding the conditions to predict hazards.
          </ul>
          <h4>Desires</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Tools that are very easy to use.
            <li>Needs to work in a rough beach environment.
            <li>Nothing that distracts from our current duties.
            <li>Any changes to our current procedure would have to be very robust.
          </ul>
          <p>After working through a number of ideation sessions we developed concepts around autonomous observation and detection.  This evolved into the ALS blim. The question now was what was the best way to interact with this piece of hardware.</p>

        <div class="row section-heading">
          <div class="col-md-12">
            <h4>Desktop</h4>
        <p>The first concept is a command center style desktop interface. This affords the operator a huge amount of control and excellent visibility.</P>
        </div>
      </div>
          <div class="col-md-5">
            <ul>
              <li>Barry is in the Surf Club and has a live view of the beach with overlays showing him everything about the current beach conditions.
              <li>With this information he can make informed decisions about flag placement and locations for lifesavers to patrol.
              <li>The system is constantly monitoring the location and body language of swimmers.
              <li>The system flags a swimmer as being in distress and raises an alarm for Barry.
              <li>Barry can allow the system to respond automatically and dispatch a Lifesaver, or he can take over and respond as he sees fit.
              <li>He can monitor the rescue as it takes place and execute additional actions as necessary, such as assigning additional lifeguards or calling for an ambulance.
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="row section-heading">
            <div class="col-md-12">
            <h4>Mobile</h4>
            <p>The Second concept is a mobile application, this would be accessible to everyone on duty. It allows the user to have a birds eye view of the beach when they want it. It can also be used to communicate with other people on duty and as a news feed of important events on the beach.  The app will sound a notification when I detects someone in distress. </P>
            </div>
          </div>

              <div class="col-md-5">
                <ul>
                  <li>With the mobile set up the the user is not expected to be monitoring the system.
                  <li>However they are still able to gain insights into the beach conditions to help make informed choices.
                  <li>When a distressed swimmer is identified by the system all users are notified on there phones and are able to respond appropriately.
                  <li>In this scenario Annabel our patrol captain is able to review the notification and decide if they really are in distress.
                  <li>Shes can then respond appropriately, dispatching other surf lifesavers if necessary.
                  <li>The app can also notify emergency services and provide accurate location information to assist first responders.
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p>Both Concepts were developed using paper prototypes and tested with users to refine them.  We proceeded to high fidelity with the mobile app as this best met the needs of our user group.</P>

          <h3>Phase Three</h3>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>The mobile app is developed further into a high fidelity interactive mockup.  This was built using Framer, framer allowed us to build a high level of complexity into the app prototype.

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Everyone knows the feeling of losing focus, but for a lifesaver that moment can mean the difference between life and death. Armed with nothing more than a pair of binoculars the way we partole beaches has remained largely unchanged since the inception of the the volunteer organisation.   But with rapid advancements in vision tracking software and autonomous systems used to identify hazards in an autonomous vehicle.  We believe there is a better way to partrole our beaches.
          </p>
          <p>
          Designed for a future 10 years from now, our solution is to take the burden of attention solely off of lifesavers and share it with an autonomous blimp.  But why a blimp, unlike existing drone technology a blimp is a permanent fixture and not a temporary vehicle.  Anchored to a buoy and flying high above the water.  The blimp has an unobstructed top down view of the beach without the flight time limitations of a drone.  Taking advantage of a wide variety of sensors the ALS is capable autonomously detecting hazards that a Lifesaver might miss.
